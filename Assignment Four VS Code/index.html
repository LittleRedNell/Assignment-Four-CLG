<h1>East Coast Native Bees</h1>
<!--Main Content -->
<p>Australian native stingless bees are a wonderful addition to your backyard, courtyard, balcony or deck. They make an easy to care for, enjoyable, trouble-free pet and are a valuable asset to our natural environment.  Bees support pollination - so keeping bees will help maintain native flora in addition to your backyard vegetable crops, herbs and gardens.</p>

<p>Our business, East Coast Native Bees, endeavours to support native bee populations by supplying backyard bee keepers of south east Queensland with Australian Native Stingless Bee hives. We manufacture our own hives using quality materials that aim to sustain a bee population for as long as possible whilst providing the hive with adequate environmental conditions to support the health of the hive. </p>

<h2>Keeping Australian Native Bees</h2>
<p>Australian Native Bees are either solitary or live in a colony. Most native bees are solitary, however there are several species of native bees that live in a colony and can be kept in a bee box in your own backyard.</p>
