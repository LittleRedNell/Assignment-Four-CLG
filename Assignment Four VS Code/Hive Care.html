<h1>Caring for your <em>Australian Native Stingless Bees</em></h1>
<!--Main Content -->
<p><em>Australian Native Stingless Bees</em> are very self sufficient and once they are located in a suitable place in your yard or on your balcony, there is very little more that needs to be done. The main things to be aware of are <strong>summer heat</strong> (temperatures over 38<sup>oC</sup>) and <strong>predators</strong>. An ideal place for a native bee hive is in place that provides shade in summer and sun in winter. Bees will only be active at temperatures >18<sup>oC</sup> thus it is important to provide some sun in winter to ensure they have adequate time during the day for activity to collect stores<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>On hot summer days (38<sup>oC</sup>), bees may 'fan' at the entry to the hive. There are a few simple things you can do to prevent the bees overheating:</p>
<p>When selecting a site for your bees, ensure it is somewhere that will be in shade in summer.</p>
<p>If your bees are exhibiting signs the hive is hot (fanning at entry), place a wet towel over the top of the hive and/or you may drill a small (4mm) hole in the back of the <ins>top of the middle</ins> <del>top/MIDDLE?</del> section of the hive to help heat escape<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>There are several <strong>predators</strong> which will attack native bee hives and can quickly result in the destruction and death of a hive. It is very important to familiarise yourself with these <strong>predators</strong> and check your hive regularly to ensure it is not being attacked.</p>
