<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>We are a family business that started simply for the love of bees. We each have a background in environmental science and ecology. We purchased our first Australian stingless bee hive several years ago and our interest in native bees has grown since then. We found enjoyment watching the bees come and go each day, discovering them on flowers in our garden and smelling the sweet honey smell that emanates from the hives. Additionally, we found satisfaction in knowing we were supporting such an important component of Australian ecology; a tiny bee with a big role in pollination - pollinating a vast array of plants including Australian native flora, backyard gardens and farming crops.  </p> 

<p>We build our hives ourselves using the /////design. We aim to build hives that create an appropriate balance between environmental (housing) requirements for bees and longevity; to withstand outdoor elements for as long as possible in the harsh Australian environment.
