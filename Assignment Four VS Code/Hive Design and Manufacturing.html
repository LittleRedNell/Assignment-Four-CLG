<h1>Bee Box Design</h1>
<!--Main Content -->
<p>Our bee boxes are built based on the ////design.  After much research we decided this design provided the best environment for Australian native stingless bees in addition to having the capacity to be built for longevity. The Australian climate is harsh and a strong bee box will withstand the elements while still providing optimal conditions for the bees. </p>
<h2>Manufacturing Process</h2>
<p>We preferentially build our bee boxes from hoop pine but also build from other timbers such as cypress pine when hoop pine supplies are limited. We aim for a timber that provides adequate winter/summer insulation for the bees, will ensure box longevity so long as the box is cared for and also provides for ease of construction.  We tend to use softer timbers rather than pure hard woods as we find the insulation capacities of hard wood are more confined (hold the heat at the end of the day in summer, take a long time to heat up in winter). Whilst some softer timbers may heat more quickly that hard woods, we find overall that the thickness of the timber provides adequate insulation and on particularly hot days (>37 degrees), it is prudent to check on hives to ensure the bees are cool enough regardless of the type of hive you own. Bees can suffer in extreme heat and there are some simple, small measures you can take to ensure they stay cool. </p>
